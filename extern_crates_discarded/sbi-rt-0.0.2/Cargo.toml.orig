[features]
default = []
# Implement sbi-rt traits for integer types
# By using this feature, parameter types of sbi-rt functions fall back to integers,
# static type checks are disabled so this library won't detect parameters in incorrect orders.
# Although some people may find it userul in prototyping sbi-rt implementations,
# users of this crate are strongly encouraged not to enable this feature in production.
integer-impls = []
# Support legacy extension; this feature is not included by default.
