One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as data bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual data and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate data bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.; Number of NCS (non-coherent standard) flits received over QPI.    This includes extended headers.",

    "PublicDescription": "Counts the number of flits trasmitted across the QPI Link.  This is one of three groups that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for NDR, NCB, and NCS message classes.  Each flit is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four fits, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI speed (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the transfers here refer to fits.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 flit at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as data bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual data and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate data bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.; Number of NCS (non-coherent standard) flits transmitted over QPI.    This includes extended headers.",
