Generally, when data is transmitted across QPI, it will bypass the RxQ and pass directly to the ring interface.  If things back up getting transmitted onto the ring, however, it may need to allocate into this buffer, thus increasing the latency.  This event can be used in conjunction with the Flit Buffer Not Empty event to calculate average occupancy, or with the Flit Buffer Allocations event to track average lifetime.  This monitors SNP flits only.",
