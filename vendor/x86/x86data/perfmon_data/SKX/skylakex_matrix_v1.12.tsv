PF_L2_DATA_RD	Null	0x0010 	0,1	Counts prefetch (that bring data to L2) data reads
PF_L2_RFO	Null	0x0020 	0,1	Counts all prefetch (that bring data to L2) RFOs
PF_L3_DATA_RD	Null	0x0080 	0,1	Counts all prefetch (that bring data to LLC only) data reads
PF_L3_RFO	Null	0x0100 	0,1	Counts all prefetch (that bring data to LLC only) RFOs
PF_L1D_AND_SW	Null	0x0400 	0,1	Counts L1 data cache hardware prefetch requests and software prefetch requests
OTHER	Null	0x8000 	0,1	Counts any other requests
ALL_PF_DATA_RD	Null	0x0490 	0,1	Counts all prefetch data reads
ALL_PF_RFO	Null	0x0120 	0,1	Counts prefetch RFOs
ALL_DATA_RD	Null	0x0491 	0,1	Counts all demand & prefetch data reads
ALL_RFO	Null	0x0122 	0,1	Counts all demand & prefetch RFOs
ALL_READS	Null	0x07f7	0,1	Counts all data/code/rfo reads (demand & prefetch)
Null	ANY_RESPONSE	0x000001 	0,1	have any response type.
Null	L3_HIT.NO_SNOOP_NEEDED	0x01003c 	0,1	hit in the L3 and sibling core snoops are not needed as either the core-valid bit is not set or the shared line is present in multiple cores.
Null	L3_HIT.HIT_OTHER_CORE_NO_FWD	0x04003c 	0,1	hit in the L3 and the snoops to sibling cores hit in either E/S state and the line is not forwarded.
Null	L3_HIT.HIT_OTHER_CORE_FWD	0x08003c 	0,1	hit in the L3 and the snoop to one of the sibling cores hits the line in E/S/F state and the line is forwarded.
Null	L3_HIT.HITM_OTHER_CORE	0x10003c 	0,1	hit in the L3 and the snoop to one of the sibling cores hits the line in M state and the line is forwarded.
Null	L3_HIT.ANY_SNOOP	0x3f803c 	0,1	hit in the L3.
Null	L3_MISS.ANY_SNOOP	0x3fbc00	0,1	miss in the L3.
Null	L3_MISS.REMOTE_HIT_FORWARD	0x083fc0	0,1	miss the L3 and clean or shared data is transferred from remote cache.
Null	L3_MISS.REMOTE_HITM	0x103fc0	0,1	miss the L3 and the modified data is transferred from remote cache.
Null	L3_MISS.SNOOP_MISS_OR_NO_FWD	0x063fc0	0,1	miss the L3 and the data is returned from local or remote dram.
Null	L3_MISS_REMOTE_DRAM.SNOOP_MISS_OR_NO_FWD	0x063b80	0,1	miss the L3 and the data is returned from remote dram.
Null	L3_MISS_LOCAL_DRAM.SNOOP_MISS_OR_NO_FWD	0x060400	0,1	miss the L3 and the data is returned from local dram.
