BitName	BitIndex	FlopsMultiplier	Description
SCALAR_DOUBLE	0	1	Number of SSE/AVX computational scalar double precision floating-point instructions retired.  Each count represents 1 computation. Applies to SSE* and AVX* scalar double precision floating-point instructions: ADD SUB MUL DIV MIN MAX SQRT FM(N)ADD/SUB.  FM(N)ADD/SUB instructions count twice as they perform multiple calculations per element.
SCALAR_SINGLE	1	1	Number of SSE/AVX computational scalar single precision floating-point instructions retired.  Each count represents 1 computation. Applies to SSE* and AVX* scalar single precision floating-point instructions: ADD SUB MUL DIV MIN MAX RCP RSQRT SQRT FM(N)ADD/SUB.  FM(N)ADD/SUB instructions count twice as they perform multiple calculations per element.
128BIT_PACKED_DOUBLE	2	2	Number of SSE/AVX computational 128-bit packed double precision floating-point instructions retired.  Each count represents 2 computations. Applies to SSE* and AVX* packed double precision floating-point instructions: ADD SUB MUL DIV MIN MAX SQRT DPP FM(N)ADD/SUB.  DPP and FM(N)ADD/SUB instructions count twice as they perform multiple calculations per element.
128BIT_PACKED_SINGLE	3	4	Number of SSE/AVX computational 128-bit packed single precision floating-point instructions retired.  Each count represents 4 computations. Applies to SSE* and AVX* packed single precision floating-point instructions: ADD SUB MUL DIV MIN MAX RCP RSQRT SQRT DPP FM(N)ADD/SUB.  DPP and FM(N)ADD/SUB instructions count twice as they perform multiple calculations per element.
256BIT_PACKED_DOUBLE	4	4	Number of SSE/AVX computational 256-bit packed double precision floating-point instructions retired.  Each count represents 4 computations. Applies to SSE* and AVX* packed double precision floating-point instructions: ADD SUB MUL DIV MIN MAX SQRT DPP FM(N)ADD/SUB.  DPP and FM(N)ADD/SUB instructions count twice as they perform multiple calculations per element.
256BIT_PACKED_SINGLE	5	8	Number of SSE/AVX computational 256-bit packed single precision floating-point instructions retired.  Each count represents 8 computations. Applies to SSE* and AVX* packed single precision floating-point instructions: ADD SUB MUL DIV MIN MAX RCP RSQRT SQRT DPP FM(N)ADD/SUB.  DPP and FM(N)ADD/SUB instructions count twice as they perform multiple calculations per element.
