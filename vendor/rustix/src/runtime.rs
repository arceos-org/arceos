//! Low-level implementation details for libc-like runtime libraries such as
//! [origin].
//!
//! Do not use the functions in this module unless you've read all of their
//! code, *and* you know all the relevant internal implementation details of
//! any libc in the process they'll be used.
//!
//! These functions are for implementing thread-local storage (TLS), managing
//! threads, loaded libraries, and other process-wide resources. Most of
//! `rustix` doesn't care about what other libraries are linked into the
//! program or what they're doing, but the features in this module generally
//! can only be used by one entity within a process.
//!
//! The API for these functions is not stable, and this module is
//! `doc(hidden)`.
//!
//! [origin]: https://github.com/sunfishcode/mustang/tree/main/origin
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! This module is intended to be used for implementing a runtime library such
//! as libc. Use of these features for any other purpose is likely to create
//! serious problems.

///  - Accessing any memory shared with the parent, such as a [`MAP_SHARED`]
///    mapping, even with anonymous or [`memfd_create`] mappings, as this could
///    cause undefined behavior.
