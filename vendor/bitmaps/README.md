# bitmaps

A fixed size compact boolean array in Rust.

## Overview

This crate provides a convenient and efficient way of declaring and working with
fixed size bitmaps in Rust. It was originally split out from the [sized-chunks]
crate and its primary purpose is to support it, but the `Bitmap` type has proven
to be generally useful enough that it was split off into a separate crate.

## Example

```rust
use bitmaps::Bitmap;

fn main() {
    let mut bitmap = Bitmap::<10>::new();
    assert_eq!(bitmap.set(5, true), false);
    assert_eq!(bitmap.set(5, true), true);
    assert_eq!(bitmap.get(5), true);
    assert_eq!(bitmap.get(6), false);
    assert_eq!(bitmap.len(), 1);
    assert_eq!(bitmap.set(3, true), false);
    assert_eq!(bitmap.len(), 2);
    assert_eq!(bitmap.first_index(), Some(3));
    assert_eq!(bitmap.last_index(), Some(5));
}
```
