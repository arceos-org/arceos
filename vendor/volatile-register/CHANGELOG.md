## [Unreleased]

## [v0.2.1] - 2021-08-14

### Added

- Added more docs.rs targets

## [v0.2.0] - 2017-03-07

### Changed

- The `modify` and `write` operations now take `&self`.

- [breaking-change] `RO` and `RW` no longer implement `Sync`. This is required
  to make the new `modify` and `write` sound.

- [breaking-change] `RO`, `RW` and `WO` now require that the inner value be
  `Copy`-able.

- docs: remove "guarantee" about some operations being atomic as this crate may
  be used in architectures different than the ARM Cortex-M.

## v0.1.0 - 2016-09-27
