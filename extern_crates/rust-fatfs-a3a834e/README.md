A FAT filesystem library implemented in Rust.

Features:
* read/write file using standard Read/Write traits
* read directory contents
* create/remove file or directory
* rename/move file or directory
* read/write file timestamps (updated automatically if `chrono` feature is enabled)
* format volume
* FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 compatibility
* LFN (Long File Names) extension is supported
* Basic no_std environment support
* logging configurable at compile time using cargo features

Usage
-----

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

    [dependencies]
    fatfs = "0.4"

You can start using the `fatfs` library now:

    let img_file = File::open("fat.img")?;
    let fs = fatfs::FileSystem::new(img_file, fatfs::FsOptions::new())?;
    let root_dir = fs.root_dir();
    let mut file = root_dir.create_file("hello.txt")?;
    file.write_all(b"Hello World!")?;

Note: it is recommended to wrap the underlying file struct in a buffering/caching object like `BufStream` from
`fscommon` crate. For example:

    let buf_stream = BufStream::new(img_file);
    let fs = fatfs::FileSystem::new(buf_stream, fatfs::FsOptions::new())?;

See more examples in the `examples` subdirectory.

no_std usage
------------

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

    [dependencies]
    fatfs = { version = "0.4", default-features = false }

Additional features:

* `lfn` - LFN (long file name) support
* `alloc` - use `alloc` crate for dynamic allocation. Needed for API which uses `String` type. You may have to provide
a memory allocator implementation.
* `unicode` - use Unicode-compatible case conversion in file names - you may want to have it disabled for lower memory
footprint
* `log_level_*` - enable specific logging levels at compile time.
The options are as follows:
  * `log_level_error` - enable only error-level logging.
  * `log_level_warn` - enable warn-level logging and higher.
  * `log_level_info` - enable info-level logging and higher.
  * `log_level_debug` - enable debug-level logging and higher.
  * `log_level_trace` - (default) enable all logging levels, trace and higher.

Note: above features are enabled by default and were designed primarily for `no_std` usage.
